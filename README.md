# 3d-bible-gallery

This is a simple 3D web app where users can explore a gallery of bible verses in a peaceful room. Small project made for the Computer Graphics lab during my third year of Computer Engineering studies at Polytechnic University of Timi»ôoara.

And then simply visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.
